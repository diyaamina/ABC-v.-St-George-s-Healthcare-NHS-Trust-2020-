# ABC-v.-St-George-s-Healthcare-NHS-Trust-2020-

### Who was involved?:

### Summary of Medical History & Background:
The chronology of ABC's medical journey is fundamental to appreciating the timing and nature of each legal and ethical decision point.


In 2009, clincial suspicions arose that her father suffered from Huntington's Disease, a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive cognitive, psychatric, and motor dysfunction, resulting from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT). This is a highly penetrant monogenetic disorder, with every child of an affected parent carrying a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation.


The father was referred for genetic testing following multidisciplinary assessment. The diagnosis was confirmed in Novmeber 2009. However, throughout the period when predicitve knowledge of the genetic mutation would have been most crucial for ABC, who was visibly pregnant, her father consistently withheld concent for information sharing, even following repeated inquiries from clinicians.


After the birth of ABC's daughter in April 2010, a clinician inadvertently referenced the gather's Huntington's diagnosis in conversation with ABC in August 2010. She underwent confirmatory genetic testing for the Huntington's mutation and, in January 2013, was diagnosed as a carrier. Given the nature of HD, the diagnosis carried major implications for her health, future, and, most critically for this litigation, her daughter's genetic risk. 


Routine practice in the UK does not support predictive testing for children until adulthood, so ABC was left with uncertianty regarding her daughter's own status, compounding her psychological distress.
### Context:
In 2007, the claiment's father, referred to as XX, shot and killed her mother. He was convicted of manslaughter by reason of deminished responsibility and was detained by hospital order under the Mental Health Act 1983. During his detention, XX came under the care of multidisciplinary clinicians from multiple NHS Trusts, specifically, St George's Healthcare NHS Trust, South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.


The family context was highly fraught: not only had ABC lost her mother at the hands of her father, but she was facing the criminal justice system, the mental health system, and the risk of serious genetic illness.


In 2009, around the time Huntington's Disease (HD) was being considered as a likely diagnosis of her father, ABC herself became pregnant. The clinical and familial situation thus became more urgent as a child could potentially inherit a devastating genetic disorder. Importantly, XX's diagnosis was suspected and then later confirmed in late 2009, leading to significant implications for his children, including a 50% chance of genetic transmission according to the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern typical of Huntington's Disease.


Despite this, XX was adamant that his daughters not be told of this diagnosis, fearing not only the emotional impact, but also the potential decisions regarding abortion. He made this clear repeatedly to his clinicians, particularly after learning of ABC's preganancy. The clincial staff, balancing their duty of confidentiality toward XX with awareness of ABC's risk, ultimately respected his wishes.


ABC, therefore, proceeded through her pregnancy without knowledge of her own major risk. A few months after her daughter's birth in April 2010, she was informed accidentally of her father's diagnosis by a clincian. She subsequently underwent genetic testing and, in January 2013, was herself diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. The cascade of events proved life changing: as a single mother, ABC now faced the spectre of degenerative, untreatable disease for both herself and the 50% risk for her child.

### Issues:
The crucial legal issue became whether the clincial team's decision not to inform ABC could constitute negligence in law, especially given they were following the established patient's wishes and clinical guidance regarding confidentiality.

ABC had to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that earlier disclosure would have lef not only to testing but also to termination. This addresses both factual and speculative hurdles, particularly regarding her intentions, timing of testing, and the legal timeframe for lawful termination of her pregnancy.

### Legal Context:
Wrongful birth claims generally involve circumstances in which a patient alleges that negligence deprived her of the opportunity to avoid the birth of a child affected by serious medical conditions, usually through termination of pregnancy. In ABC's case, the wrongful birth aspect was not of a healthy but unwanted child but encompassed asserted loss of reproductive autonomy and the birth of a child at 50% risk of Huntington's Disease in which she unknowingly carried.

The viability of the wrongful birth claim depended upon linking the defendants' omission, their failure to disclose her father's diagnosis, to her inability to take reproductive action. 

Legally, she needed to establish:
1. That her duty of care existed
2. That it had been breached
3. That the breach caused of the birth of a child who would otherwise not have been born

### Application:
The Caparo Industries v. Dickman (1990) test provided that, for duty of care to be established in negligence, three conditions must be satisfied:
1. damage must be foreseeable
2. a relationship of proximity or neighbourhood must exist
3. it must be fair, just, and reasonable to impose duty

In ABC's case:
Forseeability: Uncontroversially satisfied. Clinicians knew that if ABC was not told of her genetic risk, and was pregnant, serious harm could result.


Proximity: A more contentious element. Promimity was argued both via the family relationship as genetic relative (i.e., a directly identifiable member of the risk pool) and via ABC's attendance at family therapy, possibly bringing her directly into the clincial ambit of at least some defendants. 


Fair, Just, and Reasonable: The Court of Appeal considered a range of policy arguements such as risk to confidentiality, opening of "floodgates," undermining trust, and exposing clincians to conflicting legal jeopardy if a duty to third parties were accepted. Yet, it found that these were not so overwhelming as to rule out the claimant's case as "unarguable". This means the presence of established professional guidance supporting exceptional disclosure to prevent harm rendered rigid application of the status quo unsatisfactory.

Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights is central in any litigation that touches on privacy, family life, and the release or withholding of personal medical information. Both ABC and the NHS trusts invoked Article 8, but applied it to different ways.


ABC's Arguement: She invoked Article 8 in support of her right to be informed of her genetic risk, a right to personal autonomy, family life, and informed reproductive choices.

Defendants' Arguement: They contended that the confidentiality of XX's medical information was equally protected under Article 8, and that any interference with his rights (by disclosing to ABC without consent) would require a powerful justification and would need to be proportionate.

### Defendants' Confidentiality Duty Arguments:
The defendants contended that patient confidentiality is important to the doctor and patient relationship as well as the broader publix trust in healthcare.

Their core arguements were:

There were no recognised legal duty to third parties concerning disclosure of patient genetic information in the absence of patient consent.


### What could have been done differently?:
The clinicians could have saught an ethics committee review earlier, especially given the gravity of withholding genetic risk from a pregnant women. This might have offered a structured way to balance confidentiality with potential harm to ABC and her unborn child.


The medical team could have documented the foreseeable risk to ABC more explicitly, strengthening the argument for a duty of care. This would have helped establish whether the harm was truly "reasonably foreseeable", a key legal threshold.

### Reflection:

The case highlights the conflict between medical confidentiality and the duty to warn. ABC's late discovery of her father's Huntington's diagnosis denied her the chance to make informed reproductive choices, causing preventable harm. It shows that genetic information isn't just personal, it's rational. As medicine evolves, the law must adapt to protect those indirectly affected, balancing privacy with foreseeable risk.

I'd advocate for clearer GMC guidance or NHS protocols on disclosing genetic risk, even without consent, when harm is foreseeable. My legal argument would centre on ABC's right to autonomy and the emotional impact of nondisclosure. Beyond the case, I'd push for policy reform to support clincians in ethically complex situations, ensuring law and care move in step.
