# ABC-v.-St-George-s-Healthcare-NHS-Trust-2020-

### Who was involved?:

### Summary of Medical History & Background:


### Context:
In 2007, the claiment's father, referred to as XX, shot and killed her mother. He was convicted of manslaughter by reason of deminished responsibility and was detained by hospital order under the Mental Health Act 1983. During his detention, XX came under the care of multidisciplinary clinicians from multiple NHS Trusts, specifically, St George's Healthcare NHS Trust, South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.


The family context was highly fraught: not only had ABC lost her mother at the hands of her father, but she was facing the criminal justice system, the mental health system, and the risk of serious genetic illness.


In 2009, around the time Huntington's Disease (HD) was being considered as a likely diagnosis of her father, ABC herself became pregnant. The clinical and familial situation thus became more urgent as a child could potentially inherit a devastating genetic disorder. Importantly, XX's diagnosis was suspected and then later confirmed in late 2009, leading to significant implications for his children, including a 50% chance of genetic transmission according to the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern typical of Huntington's Disease.


Despite this, XX was adamant that his daughters not be told of this diagnosis, fearing not only the emotional impact, but also the potential decisions regarding abortion. He made this clear repeatedly to his clinicians, particularly after learning of ABC's preganancy. The clincial staff, balancing their duty of confidentiality toward XX with awareness of ABC's risk, ultimately respected his wishes.


ABC, therefore, proceeded through her pregnancy without knowledge of her own major risk. A few months after her daughter's birth in April 2010, she was informed accidentally of her father's diagnosis by a clincian. She subsequently underwent genetic testing and, in January 2013, was herself diagnosed with Huntington's Disease. The cascade of events proved life changing: as a single mother, ABC now faced the spectre of degenerative, untreatable disease for both herself and the 50% risk for her child.
